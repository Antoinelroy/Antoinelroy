### Welcome to my profile!

Currently working as a Sailpoint Developer (java) @Desjardins

Right now you can go check my 136App repository which is an IOS/Android mobile dice game invented by my friends and implemented by me. I used Xamarin Forms to do it because at that time I was learning C# and wanted to see if I could create an app with it. It's far from being done but at least it's playable. My future plans for this game would be to rewrite it using something like React Native and making it multiplayer (multiple devices on one game). Overall it's a really fun game to play in a party!

You can also check my Spacestagram repository. It's an interactive website using NASA's APOD API to like photos of space! I wrote that project using React in like 2 days because I heard of a job opportunity at Shopify and they were asking for a small project using NASA's APIs. The deadline for submitting an application was in 2 days, so I got to work and I was pretty satisfied with the results. My plans for this project would be to hook it up to a firebase database and give the user more options (I.E. filtering options, a profile page, etc.)

Then there is the Renter's Place repository. That was a school project that I needed to create using MSSQL server for the database and the .NET framework to create the website. It is my first three tier application on this github, you should go check it out!

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have a question about these projects or if you have a job for me.

Cheers,

Antoine
