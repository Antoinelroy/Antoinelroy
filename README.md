### Welcome to my profile!

I am a student and soon to be in the job market for a developer job. I am avid to learn new stuff and eager to implement funky algorithms!

I am currently finishing an AEC in Information Technology Programmer-Analyst at LaSalle College in Montreal and so far I have loved my experience.
There is not a lot of projects on this account right now, but I plan to add more and more as I progress deeper in the world of computer science.

Right now you can go check my 136App repository which is an IOS/Android mobile dice game invented by my friends and implemented by me. Its a really fun game to play in a party (wink wink)

You can also check my Spacestagram repository. It's an interactive website using NASA's APOD API to like photos of space!

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have a question about these projects or if you have a job for me ;)

Cheers,

Antoine
